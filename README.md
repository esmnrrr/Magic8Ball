Yesterday I join Microfon's Education which name is Coding with Generative AI. They give us a mission. It is about a creating a website which uses HTML, CSS and JS, but they didn't to code ourselves, we need to take help from any AI, so I took help from ChatGPT and DeepSeek to code this website. 

This website have 30 different chances with 30 different color and some animations. We ask a question and we wait a few seconds and see which results turns to us. 

It is like a fortune game. It decides what should we do for that question.
